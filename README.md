## hey 🤲
## ha ha it means can resemble certain sign language movements ✌️
🚀 An AI-powered project to perform image recognition using ORB feature detection and matching with OpenCV.

## Features ✨
- 📸 **Real-time Image Recognition** using camera input.
- 🔍 **ORB Feature Detection** for extracting keypoints and descriptors.
- 🤖 **KNN Matching** to find and recognize objects from a set of images.
- 💻 Easy integration with other AI models for enhanced functionalities.

## Workflow Overview 🔗
1. **Load Images**: Read and process images from a specified directory.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use ORB to detect and compute features.
3. **Camera Input**: Capture live video feed from the webcam.
4. **Match Detection**: Identify and display recognized classes in real-time.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations.
- **OS**: For file and directory operations.
